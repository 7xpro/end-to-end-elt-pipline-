Here’s a clear and professional description of your ELT data pipeline — suitable for your documentation, interviews, or portfolio:

## ✅ **ELT Data Pipeline Description**

### 🔁 Overview:

This pipeline is designed to extract product data from Amazon using **Scrapy**, store raw data in **Amazon S3**, transform it using **AWS Lambda**, and then re-store the cleaned data into a **partitioned S3 bucket** for analytics using **AWS Glue and Athena**.

---

### 📥 1. **Extraction (E)** – *Scrapy Spider*

* The pipeline begins with a **Scrapy-based crawler** that scrapes product details (name, price, rating, etc.) from Amazon.
* The spider runs daily or on-demand and outputs data in **JSON** format.
* Raw data is pushed directly to a raw S3 bucket:

  ```
  s3://amazon-data-lake/raw/
  ```

---

### 🔧 2. **Loading Raw Data (L)** – *S3 Storage*

* Scraped files are organized and uploaded to:

  ```
  s3://amazon-data-lake/raw/YYYY-MM-DD/amazon_raw.json
  ```
* Each day’s crawl is stored in its own dated folder for traceability.

---

### 🔄 3. **Transformation (T)** – *AWS Lambda Function*

* An **AWS Lambda** function is triggered upon object creation in the raw bucket.
* It performs cleaning and normalization tasks such as:

  * Ensuring data types (e.g., converting `rating` to `float`)
  * Removing duplicates or empty fields
  * Standardizing column names
* The transformed data is saved in **cleaned, partitioned folders** in another S3 bucket:

  ```
  s3://amazon-data-lake/clean/year=2025/month=07/day=05/cleaned_data.json
  ```

---

### 🧠 4. **Cataloging** – *AWS Glue Crawler*

* A **Glue Crawler** scans the cleaned S3 bucket.
* It infers the schema from the partitioned structure and updates the **AWS Glue Data Catalog**.
* This makes the data queryable in **Amazon Athena**.

---

### 🔍 5. **Querying** – *Amazon Athena*

* Example query:

  ```sql
  SELECT name, current_price, rating
  FROM amazon_cleaned_data
  WHERE year = '2025' AND month = '07' AND day = '05'
    AND brand = 'Xiaomi';
  ```
* The use of partition filters ensures **optimized query performance and lower cost**.
